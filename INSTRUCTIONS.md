## Stretch Mode

Add styling or extra functionality that fits with the theme of this assignment.

Once the employee is deleted, update the total spend on salaries account for this employee's removal. This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. You will need to use `.text()` as a getter or look into jQuery's `.data()` function. This is tricky! 

## Reminder About Modes

Above, we introduced the concept of levels of difficulty. "Mode" is how we will typically refer to each level. Below is a brief explanation of

* what to expect when attempting each mode
* if they are required or not

Mode | Description
--- | ---
Base | required
Stretch | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research
